This mod and countless others wouldn't exist without Minecraft Forge. Huge thanks to them for making modding possible!  As for Gramarye, a big pat on the back for its main developer... me! (Yes, that's right, I'm Seristic).  And of course, a massive thank you to Mojang, the glorious mad wizards who built this incredible game and keep the modding scene thriving!
